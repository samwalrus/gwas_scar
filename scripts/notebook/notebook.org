* About

This notebook is written as an emacs org file and exported into html
and pdf formats. 
The GIT hub repositry is https://github.com/samwalrus/gwas_scar
Code blocks are in bash, R and prolog (only the subset required for
defining makeprog files for Biomake.)


** Initial Setup for interactive code.

To run the R code in this note book on BC4 as an interactive job you
need to:
1. Open this .org file in emacs.
2. Open a shell (M-x shell) on BC4 over tramp.
3. Start an interactive slurm job on BC4 [[ijob]]
4. Start R in this shell and run `M-x ess-remote` to connect to the
   ess session.

#+NAME: ijob
#+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
srun --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --mem=10G --time=04:00:00 --pty bash -i
#+END_src


The R code that is part of one R session block will have its src_code
block labelled source: \*shell*. In order to recreate the published
results the R code needs to be run sequentially in order.
